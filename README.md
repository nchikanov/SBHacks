# SBHacks
Desktop app for SB Hacks 2017, modeled after Dance Marathon @ UCLA
Languages used: C#, Javascript
Application used: Unity2D

# Inspiration
For the past 16 years, the Pediatric AIDS Coalition at UCLA has put on a 26-hour Dance Marathon to combat the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS while raising funds for three main beneficiaries, the biggest of which being the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation. We thought it'd be cool to design a game to raise awareness about the event and the cause behind Dance Marathon.

# What it does
Player can navigate horizontally using the right and left arrow keys to collect falling items and increase their score. After 30 seconds, the player moves on to the next level if they reach their score goal for the level.

# How we built it
Using Unity's IDE and platform, we wrote scripts in C# and Javascript to support any functionality of objects. We borrowed assets from Unity's online asset store and other free asset websites.

# Challenges we ran into
We've never worked with Unity before, so it was difficult learning the ropes and figuring out how to build the environment. We also found it challenging to randomly generate the falling objects and spawn them after a designated time. Much of the level functionality that we envisioned is not yet complete but the basics are there.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Building something that compiles and runs and is (debatably) fun!! This is the first hackathon we've attended as a team so we're really proud that we were able to follow through with our idea and run with a new programming language and video game editor.

# What we learned
TONS. How to work with Unity, C#, Javascript, etc. But also how much time and commitment it takes to learn these skills to deploy something...but with enough diligence anything is possible! (Also we need sleep)

# What's next for DM2017
- Want the player to have some sort of HP and 5 lives total. HP decreases every time the player fails a level and once they're out of HP, they lose a life and start the game over.
- Keep track of score from level to level
- Implement 26 levels with different themes every 3 levels
- Introduce "bad objects" that automatically "kill" the player or put him to sleep
- Better graphics
- Make levels increasingly harder as we go
